Here we see two cubes hanging out in the middle of nowhere. Blue Cube is dancing and having a real good time. However, Red Cube is fed up with Blue Cube's tomfoolery, and has finally had enough. Red Cube slams into Blue Cube at high speeds, blasting him into orbit. After a long ten second battle, Red Cube fades away from exhaustion, never to be seen again. 



For this animation I mainly used squash and stretching. This is used for both Blue Cube's animation and a majority of Red Cube's animation. I also tried applying a little bit of "Slow in and slow out" in Red Cube's attack movement, but I'm not certain if I did this right.


The emotions I wanted to convey are happiness and anger, with Blue Cube being happy and Red Cube being angry.
